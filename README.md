# Baseball Sabermetrics Project
Baseball is a sport that I have been playing since I was 6 years old. The more I played over the years, the more I have gotten into the metrics involved in the game.

This is a project where I am putting what I have learned while getting my degree in Information Systems so that I can better understand how to implement getting data, analyzing it and then displaying that data.

### How to setup
mkdir baseball_stats
cd baseball_stats
### Copy the files above

### Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Create directories
mkdir data exports notebooks

### Run the main script
python main.py

### Or run the dashboard
streamlit run dashboard.py
